# The-Binding-of-Isaac-Mod-Conversion-Kit

This is a utilitly to convert mods the PC version of The Binding of Isaac to their console counterparts.

You need to have a modified console in order to use the converted mods. I have personally tested this with the Wii U, Playstation Vita, and Nintendo 3DS

With some friendly information from SciresM The Binding of Isaac on the Nintendo Switch uses the same file formats and structure as the other consoles. So this tool should still work just the same there. Provided you can access the game's files
